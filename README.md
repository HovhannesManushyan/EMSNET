# EMSNET
Encrypted Medical Image segmentation model.\
To run the experiments of CNN run the notebook `notebooks/conv_enc.ipynb`\
To run the experiments of Vision Transformers run the notebook `notebooks/Capstone_Model_Test_Simple_Model.ipynb`\
To run the experiments of Encryption on generated data run the notebook `notebooks/main_on_generated_data.ipynb`\
To run the Remez algorithm on sigmoid, ReLU functions run the notebook `notebook/sigmoid_remez.ipynb`

The project is done by Anri Abrahamyan, Elina Israyelyan, Hovhannes Manushyan with supervision by Varduhi Yeghiazaryan
